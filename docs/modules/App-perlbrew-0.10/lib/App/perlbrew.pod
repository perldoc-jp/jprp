    perlbrew install perl-5.11.5

    # See what were installed
    perlbrew installed

    # Switch perl in the $PATH
    perlbrew switch perl-5.12.1
    perl -v

    # Switch to another version
    perlbrew switch perl-5.8.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of
perl in the users HOME. At the moment, it installs everything to
C<~/perl5/perlbrew>, and requires you to tweak your PATH by including a
bashrc/cshrc file it provides. You then can benefit from not having
to run 'sudo' commands to install cpan modules because those are
installed inside your HOME too. It's a completely separate perl
environment.

=head1 INSTALLATION

The recommended way to install perlbrew is to run these statements in
your shell:

    curl -LO http://xrl.us/perlbrew
    chmod +x perlbrew
    ./perlbrew install

After that, C<perlbrew> installs itself to C<~/perl5/perlbrew/bin>,
and you should follow the instruction on screen to setup your
C<.bashrc> or C<.cshrc> to put it in your PATH.

The directory C<~/perl5/perlbrew> will contain all install perl
executables, libraries, documentations, lib, site_libs. If you need to
install C<perlbrew>, and the perls it brews, into somewhere else
because, say, your HOME has limited quota, you can do that by setting
a C<PERLBREW_ROOT> environment variable before you run C<./perlbrew install>.

    export PERLBREW_ROOT=/mnt/perlbrew
    ./perlbrew install

The downloaded perlbrew is a self-contained standalone program that
embed all non-core modules it uses. It should be runnable with perl
5.8 or later versions of perl.

You may also install perlbrew from CPAN with cpan / cpanp / cpanm:

    cpan App::perlbrew

This installs 'perlbrew' into your current PATH and it is always
executed with your current perl.

NOTICE. When you install or upgrade perlbrew with cpan / cpanp /
cpanm, make sure you are not using one of the perls brewed with
perlbrew. If so, the `perlbrew` executable you just installed will not
be available after you swith to other perls. You might not be able to
invoke further C<perlbrew> commands after so because the executable
C<perlbrew> is not in your C<PATH> anymore. Installing it again with
cpan can temporarily solve this problem. To ensure you are not using
a perlbrewed perl, run C<perlbrew off> before upgrading.


It should be relatively safe to install C<App::perlbrew> with system
cpan (like C</usr/bin/cpan>) because then it will be installed under a
system PATH like C</usr/bin>, which is not effected by C<perlbrew switch>
command.

Again, it is recommended to let C<perlbrew> install itself. It's
easier, and it works better.

=head1 USAGE

Please read the program usage by running

    perlbrew

(No arguments.) To read a more detail one:

    perlbrew -h

Alternatively, this should also do:

    perldoc perlbrew

If you messed up too much or get confused by having to many perls
installed, you can do:

    perlbrew switch /usr/bin/perl

It will make sure that your current perl in the PATH is pointing
to C</usr/bin/perl>.

As a matter of fact the C<switch> command checks whether the given
argument is an executale or not, and create a symlink named 'perl' to
it if it is. If you really want to you are able to do:

    perlbrew switch /usr/bin/perl6

But maybe not. After running this you might not be able to run
perlbrew anymore. So be careful not making mistakes there.
