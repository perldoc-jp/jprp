partial success.

For a potentially more efficient version of this transport, see
L<Email::Sender::Transport::SMTP::Persistent>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The following attributes may be passed to the constructor:

=over

=item host - the name of the host to connect to; defaults to localhost

=item ssl - if true, connect via SSL; defaults to false

=item port - port to connect to; defaults to 25 for non-SSL, 465 for SSL

=item sasl_username - the username to use for auth; optional

=item sasl_password - the password to use for auth; must be provided if username is provided

=item allow_partial_success - if true, will send data even if some recipients were rejected

=item helo - what to say when saying HELO; no default

=item localaddr - local address from which to connect

=item localpart - local port from which to connect

=back

=head1 PARTIAL SUCCESS

If C<allow_partial_success> was set when creating the transport, the transport
may return L<Email::Sender::Success::Partial> objects.  Consult that module's
documentation.
