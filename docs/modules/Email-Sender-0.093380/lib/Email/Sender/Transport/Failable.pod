=head1 NAME

Email::Sender::Transport::Failable - a wrapper to makes things fail predictably

=head1 VERSION

version 0.093380

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This transport extends L<Email::Sender::Transport::Wrapper>, meaning that it
must be created with a C<transport> attribute of another
Email::Sender::Transport.  It will proxy all email sending to that transport,
but only after first deciding if it should fail.

It does this by calling each coderef in its C<failure_conditions> attribute,
which must be an arrayref of code references.  Each coderef will be called and
will be passed the Failable transport, the Email::Abstract object, the
envelope, and a reference to an array containing the rest of the arguments to
C<send>.

If any coderef returns a true value, the value will be used to signal failure.
