=head1 NAME

Email::Sender::Transport::Sendmail - send mail via sendmail(1)

=head1 VERSION

version 0.093380

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This transport sends mail by piping it to the F<sendmail> command.  If the
location of the F<sendmail> command is not provided in the constructor (see
below) then the library will look for an executable file called F<sendmail> in
the path.

To specify the location of sendmail:

  my $sender = Email::Sender::Transport::Sendmail->new({ sendmail => $path });
