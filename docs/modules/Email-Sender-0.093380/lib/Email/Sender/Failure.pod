=head1 NAME

Email::Sender::Failure - a report of failure from an email sending transport

=head1 VERSION

version 0.093380

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 message

This method returns the failure message, which should describe the failure.
Failures stringify to this message.

=head2 code

This returns the numeric code of the failure, if any.  This is mostly useful
for network protocol transports like SMTP.  This may be undefined.

=head2 recipients

This returns a list (or, in scalar context, an arrayref) of addresses to which
the email could not be sent.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 throw

This method can be used to instantiate and throw an Email::Sender::Failure
object at once.

  Email::Sender::Failure->throw(\%arg);

Instead of a hashref of args, you can pass a single string argument which will
be used as the C<message> of the new failure.
